# Rango Tests for WAD2 and ITECH

You can run these tests as:

`python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter3`

`python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter4`

`...`

`python manage.py test rango.tests_chapter10`

These tests are only valid for the Rango app of the Tango with Django Book (https://leanpub.com/tangowithdjango19/) up to Chapter 10. Each test runs view and model tests. If you are in Chapter 6, tests from previous chapters might fail as the structure of templates/views changes as you develop Rango.

# Requirements:

* Python 2.7
* Django-1.10
* Pillow-3.3.1
